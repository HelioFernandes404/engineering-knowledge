%----------GREETING----------
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{12pt}

%----------OPENING PARAGRAPH----------
I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position at your company. With over 5 years of experience in full-stack development and infrastructure, I have been working at the intersection of software engineering, DevOps, and AI -- areas I believe are fundamental for companies looking to scale with quality.

\vspace{12pt}

%----------BODY PARAGRAPH 1: Current Role & Impact----------
At SystemFrame, I lead technical initiatives that directly impact the business: I migrated our infrastructure from Docker to Kubernetes, reducing error rates by 45\% and achieving over 180 days of uptime with 98\% SLA. I architected an observability platform serving 10+ enterprise clients (~1,200 servers), processing millions of metrics daily. I also automated the client onboarding process, reducing deployment time from days to hours.

\vspace{12pt}

%----------BODY PARAGRAPH 2: Previous Experience & AI----------
Before that, at DAI-TEC, I had the opportunity to work with Generative AI before the current boom. I built conversational assistants using LLMs, RAG, and LangChain for 5 CRM clients, each running multiple assistants in production. This experience gave me a solid foundation in applied ML engineering -- from prompt engineering to model observability in production environments.

\vspace{12pt}

%----------BODY PARAGRAPH 3: Why This Company (customize)----------
What attracts me to startups and growing companies is the opportunity to have real, visible impact. I thrive in environments where I can contribute beyond code: participating in architecture decisions, helping define processes, and collaborating directly with product teams. I believe my experience building scalable systems from scratch, combined with my AI background, can add significant value to your team.

\vspace{12pt}

%----------CLOSING PARAGRAPH----------
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your company's technical challenges.

Best regards,

\vspace{10pt}
